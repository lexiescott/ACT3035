NOTE: Vehicle manufacturers are using an improved testing procedure, introduced for model year 2015, to determine the fuel consumption ratings of new light-duty vehicles. The improved testing produces higher fuel consumption ratings that are more representative
of everyday driving. To help you compare vehicles from different model years, the ratings for 1995-2014 vehicles have been adjusted to reflect the improved testing.

Understanding the Table
Model	4WD/4X4 = Four-wheel drive											
	AWD = All-wheel drive
	FFV = Flexible-fuel vehicle
	SWB = Short wheelbase
	LWB = Long wheelbase
	EWB = Extended wheelbase
Transmission	A = Automatic
	AM = Automated manual
	AS = Automatic with select shift
	AV = Continuously variable
	M = Manual
	3 √ê 10 = Number of gears
Fuel Type	X = Regular gasoline
	Z = Premium gasoline
	D = Diesel
	E = Ethanol (E85)
	N = Natural gas
Fuel Consumption	City and highway fuel consumption ratings are shown in litres per 100 kilometres (L/100 km) - the combined rating (55% city, 45% hwy) is shown in L/100 km and in miles per imperial gallon (mpg)
CO2 Emissions	the tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide (in grams per kilometre) for combined city and highway driving.
CO2 Rating	the tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide rated on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).
Smog Rating	the tailpipe emissions of smog-forming pollutants rated on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).
